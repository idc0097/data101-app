          Each country's geographical and waste management policies plays a role in the problem of mismanaged plastic wastes. In this case, we define mismanaged wastes as the sum of inadequately managed waste (that which is not formally managed such as 
          disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills which could leak to the surrounding environment) and littered waste.  In this visualization, mismanaged wastes was calculated to observe 
          the global share of plastics that is dumped to the oceans. One specific criteria in quantifying mismanaged is calcualating wastes 
          from a 50km distance from coasts, which may have strong probabilities ending up in coast sides. In this case, we can observe patterns among archipelagic countries.

      The global contribution in ocean plastic pollution shows a large gap between Asia and other regions. To solve the problem of
      ocean pollution, it is imperative to witness the global scale, specifically, the wide margins between continents. 
      However, it is undoubtedly that these major continents all contribute to plastic waste. Ponder on this: why do you think plastic 
      waste is highest among Asia? Is it truly global south countries who contribute to the problem? Ocean pollution is an international
      problem that may have some hints of inequality and consequences between nation states.

          Unfortunately, a lot of the plastic waste people leave behind ends up in oceans. This waste disposal issue is something that occurs worldwide. 
          We observed that the usual suspects are usually countries bordering waters or near the coastlines. Early on (i.e., 2010), some countries were more responsible than others in terms of the plastic waste contribution. 
          However, as the years went on, the contributions of each country have almost evened out. Interestingly, it seems like the Philippines increased in waste contribution as the years went on. 
          These results show that we can no longer say that certain countries are responsible for most of our waste; this is an issue popping out everywhere, 
          and we must do something about it. To the Filipinos reading this, it shows that we can no longer slide topics about the environment underneath the rug for much longer.

      As we zoom out a bit and take things from a continental perspective, the difference becomes evident. In both the 2010 and 2019 data, Asia has a massive gap to the other continents 
      as it is responsible for around 80% of plastic waste in oceans. In terms of geography, most of mainland Asia is surrounded only on three sides by oceans, with some archipelagic nations 
      like the Philippines and Indonesia on all four sides. Yet continents surrounded on all four sides by water contribute less to plastic waste than Asia. Here is something you can ponder: 
      what are the effects of these archipelagic nations on plastic waste? Should we only point the finger to coastal or seaside countries, or do inland nations have their share to play in this issue?
